#### Social Network Analysis Workshops

I teach workshops on using R for social network analysis as part of [Duke's Social Networks and Health Workshops](https://dnac.ssri.duke.edu/social-networks-health-scholars-training-program-2020.php). R has unique advantages as open source software that allows implementing sophisticated analysis techniques in a reproducible way. Previous workshops I have taught include:

* Intro to R for Social Network Analysis 
    * [Workshop materials](files/IntrotoR_ExecutedGuide.html)

* Data Cleaning for Social Network Analysis using R.
    * [Workshop materials](files/Data_Cleaning_SNA_ExecuteGuide.html)
