> **Teaching Approach**

The courses I lead promote students' learning in a welcoming environment. I carefully design my courses according to principles of effective learning through in-class activities and a strong writing component. 

#### In-class Activities 
Every class session includes in a number of hands-on individual and group activities that aim to develop students' skills in an engaging way. Some activities include: 

* Answering to anonymous online polls to assess comprehension of basic concepts
* Applying knowledge to real case scenarios
* Evaluating claims in journal articles and other media
* Utilizing available tools for a given purpose (e.g., use of library sources for finding relevant literature, using reference managers to produce a reference list)
* Developing original tools for a given purpose (e.g., creating interview guides, survey items)

#### Learning Through Writing

The courses I lead incorporate a writing component.Courses combine short assignments and a bigger project (e.g., a research proposal or research paper). Each of these strategies serves a different purpose in students' learning process. 

##### Short Assignments 

Students engage in writing early on and throughout all the course. Because writing can be a daunting task for many students, writing assigments are carefully designed to ease the process and reduce anxiety. For example, some class sessions include short, ungraded, free-writing activities during which students write anything that comes to their mind in response to one or more prompts regarding a course topic (e.g., a reading, short-lecture, or a project they are developing). Distinct prompts aim to achieve different learning goals (e.g. identification, analysis, synthesis, application). In addition, students are instructed not to pay attention to grammar or punctuation during the exercise. Free-writing sessions compel students to engage with the material in a stress-free environment. As a result, students make new connections among concepts and increase the number of observations and questions raised in class. At the end of each session, students write a one-minute paper explaining what they have learned during the session and what questions remain unanswered. 

##### Longer Projects

Longer writing projects provide the opportunity to reflect more deeply about a topic of each student's choice. Projects include research proposals, research papers, and essays. Project drafts are turned in early and often. This strategy ensures students do not cram at the end of the term. Instead, students think critically about their project continuously throughout the semester. Students share early drafts with their peers and instructor, and receive feedback so that they can improve their drafts and produce high quality pieces.

#### Continuous Development

I deliberately and continuously look for ways to become a more effective educator. As part of this improvement plan, I have recently obtained a [Certificate in Teaching Writing in the Disciplines](https://twp.duke.edu/students/graduate/certificate-program), which provides training in writing pedagogy. 
In addition, I am enrolled to obtain Duke Graduate School's [Certificate of College Teaching](https://gradschool.duke.edu/professional-development/programs/certificate-college-teaching). Through this program, I have completed systematic training in course design and effective teaching practices.
